We kicked things off with a city tour, where we had the chance to explore some of the most iconic historical sites in Manila.\n\nOur first stop was Rizal Park, also known as Luneta. We took lots of pictures and enjoyed the scenic surroundings. It was amazing to finally see the monument of our national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, in person. The park was peaceful and beautiful‚Äîa great way to begin our trip.\n\nNext, we visited Intramuros, the famous walled city of Manila. Walking through the cobblestone streets felt like stepping back in time. One of the highlights of our visit was Fort Santiago, where we had a short but meaningful recap of Philippine history. It was eye-opening to learn about the sacrifices made during the Spanish era, especially those of Rizal and the revolutionaries.\n\nBefore heading to our dorm, we made a final stop at a nearby mall for some window shopping. It was fun to relax and browse through the stores after a full day of learning and sightseeing.\n\nOverall, Day 1 was a great mix of education and fun, and it made us excited for what's to come in the next days!",
